ok i'm going to write down how to fix the error in codespaces
where when you try to start a crew it just won't

following the instructions here
https://docs.crewai.com/installation
up until like here
```
crewai create crew <your_project_name>
```
this doesn't work you get the error:
RuntimeError: Your system has an unsupported version of sqlite3. Chroma requires sqlite3 >= 3.35.0.
which sucks, the docs don't help either
